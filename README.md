## Project Title:
 OTT (over-the-top) website (Similar to Netflix)
## Objective:
Setting up an OTT platform using the MERN stack for Web Development.
## Why OTT?

OTT is a method through which audio, video and other media services are distributed directly to consumers over the internet, bypassing traditional services such as cable TV. 
## Working Methodology:
 The Project will be using MongoDB for storage, Express and Node to access JavaScript libraries to help in scripting and React to build responsive and User-friendly UI.
